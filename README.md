What are the evolutionary forces that causes the patterns in bacterial diversity across/within species that we see?
Can we reproduce these patterns using simple coalescent models (mutation and recombination)?

Which patterns are difficult to replicate? What does this say about the process of divergence/speciation/bacterial evolution?

Some hypotheses:
1. "Sexual" incompatibility in the form of distance-scaled recombination
2. Spatial structure (e.g. discrete hosts)
3. Ecological niches with selection
